# RATEMARKET
=================================================
# Problem
Our country is based on the Agricultural Field, Farming is done in various categories. Such as, Paddy
Cultivation, Vegetation and Fisheries. But, in each categories farmers (producer) and the wholesale businessmen face
a problem of choosing the proper and suitable contact to sell their valuable stock. Commonly a producer always
struggling to sell the product which he was produced. At that time may be he can’t find a suitable price for his product
or it take too much time to identify the proper whole scale salesmen to sell his products. As same as the salesmen
who are purchase the item to reselling, are struggling to collect the necessary amount of product or unable to identify
the suitable producers. This is the problem we find and decide to develop solution

# Solution
We decide to make a product to act as an intermediator for both end-points and connect them with our
application. There are no apps currently as a solution for the above problem. So, hopefully our “RATEMARKET” Smart-
phone application will be the intermediate to connect these kind of users. By using our app, the two endpoints not
only can improve their business and earing profit but also it will reduce the complexity and will find a good solution.
Our app mainly focuses on Paddy cultivators, for the moment, after step-by-step advancement we will be expanding
our app’s FOI (Field of Interest) to Vegetable cultivators, fisheries etc.
We offer this as an app to find the better (The best can only be obtained when 99% are using our app, soon it
will be) seller and the better buyer. Rather than selling to some known person for a low amount of profit, we assure he
can sell it for more than that. After he finds the person who he needs to sell his harvest, he will be given the detail to
contact him. As there are no other competitors for this app category we will implementing this as a solution for this
finding of a better buyer/seller.

# User Scenarios
Our product, “RATEMARKET”, mainly target for wholesale business on B2B (Business-to-Business) and B2P
(Business-to-Producer) throughout the country. If we consider the whole agricultural cultivator all around our country
most of them are Farming on Paddy, who look to sell their harvest for an affordable and suitable value. And a lot of
wholesale businessmen in different districts who are in need of high quality stock for a profitable price. We provide a
service of interconnecting these two end-points through our app. As on our app, both end-users will be subscribing to
our app on a monthly rental basis.
Wholesale Businessmen: Each wholesale businessmen will be giving information about what they
want and for what price they will be buying it and from which region they are in. For the wholesale business
side, there will be Smart-phone app. So, they can easily get updated and they can update their information
about the stuff they wanted. And the price schema that they prefer to be in. But, for the changing/updating
the amount of what price they will be needing, will cost them a little.
The seller (Farmers in common): Will be subscribing as the same, per monthly basis. There will be
multiple users who will be needing the seller’s harvest (stock). So our application will sort it out in ascending
order of the price of wholesaler wishes to buy his type of stock, and the region that the buyer is in, our app
will be sending SMS’ as the top-ten or top-five result businessmen nearby region of the seller is in, as the
seller wishes. Mostly the farmers will be using simple mobiles, rather than smartphones, hence this side will
be implemented in SMS and USSD.
